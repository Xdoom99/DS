# Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment and trader performance.  
The goal is to uncover patterns that can drive smarter trading strategies in the Web3 space.



# Datasets

# Methodology
1. Load datasets and inspect basic structure
2. Convert timestamps and align on a common date format
3. Merge trader data with sentiment data by date
4. Calculate key performance metrics:
   - Average and median closed PnL
   - Win rate per sentiment class
   - Trade counts
5. Analyze long vs short performance under different sentiments
6. Explore leverage patterns
7. Visualize findings using bar charts, scatter plots, violin plots, and heatmaps
8. Summarize insights for trading strategy implications
